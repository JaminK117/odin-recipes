            <h2>Method</h2>
            <div class="instructions">
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare <a href="baklava-syrup.html">baklava syrup</a></li>
                    <li>In a food processor, blitz walnuts until finely chopped. Transfer to large bowl. <br> *Note: Do not over-process nuts as they will become oily</li>
                    <li>Repeat with almonds, transferring in to the same bowl</li>
                    <li>Add sugar &amp; cinnamon to nut mixture. Combine well</li>
                    <li>Brush the base and sides of an 18x28x3.5cm pan with the melted butter</li>
                    <li>Unroll filo on to a large chopping board, placing the pan on top</li>
                    <li>Cut the filo around the pan. Discard the trimmings</li>
                    <li>Using 1 sheet of filo at a time, brush with butter and place in pan. Create 9 layers of filo</li>
                    <li>Evenly scatter half the nut mixture on top of filo</li>
                    <li>Repeat the buttering &amp; layering of the filo for another 6 sheets, placing them over the nut mixture</li>
                    <li>Evenly scatter the remaining nut mixture on top of filo</li>
                    <li>Repeat the buttering &amp; layering of a final 6 sheets of filo, laying them on top of the nut mixture. Using your hands, press the baklava to slightly compress</li>
                    <li>Brush the top well with butter</li>
                    <li> Preheat oven to 160c (fan-forced). Place the baklava in freezer for 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>Lightly score the top few layers of the baklava in to diamond shapes</li>
                    <li>Bake for 35 minutes. If the pastry is over-browning, cover with baking paper</li>
                    <li>Pour syrup over baklava as soon as removed from oven. Let stand for 2 hours or until syrup is absorbed and baklava is cool</li>
                    <li>Cut baklava in to diamond pieces, cutting along score marks made earlier</li>
                    <li>Garnish with ground pistachios</li>
                    <li>Baklava will keep for up to 1 week, covered &amp; placed in refrigerator</li>
